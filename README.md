GAN(Generative Adversarial Network) and VAE(Variational Autoencoder) fall in the category of Generative Modelling in modern machine learning. Where a Generative Modelling models the distribution based on each class by calculating the joint probability p(X,y) between the inputs and class labels and then use bayes rule to classify p(y/X). This is counterpart to discriminative modelling in which classification is based on probability estimation. Two of the modern day machine learning Generative Models are GAN and VAE. In this project we have extensively studied the working of both these generative models on a MNIST(Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) database for handwritten digits. The report consists of a high level introduction of what GAN and VAE are, along with their architectures and then we look at details of MNIST database itself. Then we explain the architectures used in this project and output results for GAN and VAE. Then we briefly explain the problems faced while working with the models and their training. Lastly, we conclude by comparing the models with each other.
